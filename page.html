      <h4><b>Travis Chambers</b></h4>
      <p>The Recycle Park project was a collaboration between the Reality Computing students and the Architecture students in UDBS. Recycle Park is a park in Pittsburgh that is being renovated with the help of UDBS. Our role in this process was to use virtual reality to help the community take an active role in the renovation by allowing them to help plan the new park.</p>

      <p>Pictured here is a sample of the April Tags used. Beneath each group of four is a family name and for our project we used the 36h11 family.</p>

      <p>Although these are different sizes, this shows the difference between the stock April Tags on the right and final tags we used on the right. As you can see the id of the tag was moved and made smaller and a lot of white space was removed also in order to make the tags as small as possible. The size of the tags was important because they had to be big enough to be seen by the cameras and also small enough that they would fit on the bottom of the models.</p>
